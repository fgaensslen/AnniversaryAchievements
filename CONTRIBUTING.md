# Contributing Translations

The only file that needs to be translated is "en.lua" in the localization folder. Please don’t translate AreaTableLocale_enUS, as it can be generated by using an automated process.

## 📚 Reference Sources

As a reference for most achievement texts, the WotLK achievements from Wowhead can be used:

https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/achievements

Only for the Quest Storylines in Outland, the WoW Retail achievement texts were used.

Some achievements include the quest ID or NPC ID in their variable name.  
You can use these IDs to find the correct reference.

### Example
QUEST_835 = "Securing the Lines"

This refers to:

https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/quest=835/securing-the-lines

Using these links helps ensure accurate translations.

## ⚠️ Please Do Not Use AI

Please do **not** use AI tools for translation.

I tested this myself with the German version, and the results were unreliable:
- Original texts were not preserved
- Content was hallucinated
- Terminology was inconsistent

Some achievements (especially in the PvP category) are custom-made and not originally from Blizzard, so manual and creative translation is required.
