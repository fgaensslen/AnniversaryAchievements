### Introduction

This addon brings you the original Achievement Interface from Blizzard into WoW Classic. It works on all Classic Servers (Era, Hardcore, Anniversary, Season of Discovery).

It integrates perfectly with the Standard UI and uses the same graphics and sounds.

Currently, nearly 385 Classic achievements (including Feats of Strength) are available.



### Supported Languages

- English
- German

For both languages, almost all achievements use original Blizzard texts and icons.

Using another WoW client language may cause some achievements not to work properly.



### Supported User Interfaces

The addon was tested with the following UIs:

- Standard
- Dragonflight UI Classic 0.31.4

### Features

- Installing the addon disables the standard quest tracker and replaces it with an object tracker for quests and achievements. Via shift-click, these objects can be removed from the tracker; left-click opens the quest or achievement window. If you don't like this behavior, you can disable it in the addon's options
- Achievements are available for various categories, including PVP, PVE, Reputations, Professions, and more. 
- Key bindings can be configured via the in-game options
- The addon integrates with Deadly Boss Mods (DBM). If you have defeated a certain boss in the past, you will receive the respective achievement upon entering a dungeon and loading DBM automatically. If you don't have DBM, there is an additional check implemented that scans your finished dungeon quests to grant you the achievements
- Achievements for explored areas can be triggered via a scan in the addon's option menu

### Notes

- Due to the huge amount of content, I couldn't test everything. If you find any bugs, wrong localization, or have great ideas for new achievements, please write a comment
- Other addons can prevent you from getting certain achievements: for example Fishing Buddy seems to interfere certain fishing achievements
- The addon works best with the Standard UI. If you have modified your interface, you can disable the micromenu button and instead use a button on your minimap
- Your achievements are NOT stored on Blizzard's servers. To backup them, go into:

    >\<your WoW folder\>/WTF/Account/\<account name\>/\<server name\>/\<character name\>/SavedVariables/AnniversaryAchievements.lua

- Guild and Statistics tabs are not available. Comparing achievements with other players who have this addon installed is also not implemented
